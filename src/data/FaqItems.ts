    question: "What should I wear to my photo session?",
    answer:
      "For professional corporate headshots and ERAS match sessions, we highly recommend formal smart business attire. Choose dark solid colors (Navy Blue, Charcoal Gray, Black) paired with light solid shirts or blouses. Avoid busy patterns, stripes, or neon colors as they draw attention away from your face. For visa photos, avoid white clothing since most embassies require white backgrounds and white shirts will blend and fade.",

Corporate headshots and residency portraits usually take between 30 to 45 minutes, allowing time for outfit changes, posing coaching, and immediate selection of the images you like best on our studio monitor.",
